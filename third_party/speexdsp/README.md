# SpeexDSP Resampler Integration

This app uses SpeexDSP's resampler implementation for Local mode sample-rate conversion in Android native code.

## Source

- Upstream: `https://github.com/xiph/speexdsp`

  - `third_party/speexdsp/include/speex_resampler.h`

## Build wiring

- `app/src/main/cpp/CMakeLists.txt` builds the vendored `resample.c` as a static library.
